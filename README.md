# 🎬 Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

A machine learning web app built with **Logistic Regression** to predict the sentiment of movie reviews — whether **Positive 😊** or **Negative 😞** — based on real IMDB data.

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🧠 **Machine Learning**: Trained on 50,000 real IMDB movie reviews using Logistic Regression.
- 💬 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Text cleaned and vectorized using TF-IDF with stopword removal.
- 🌐 **Interactive Web App**: Developed using **Streamlit**, with a clean UI and intuitive user flow.
- 🎨 **Animations**: Integrated **Lottie animations** for engaging visual feedback based on sentiment.
- 🔀 **Multi-Page Navigation**: Includes a stylish landing page and interactive prediction screen.
- 🧪 **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix for visual performance insight.
